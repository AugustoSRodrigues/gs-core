 * 3D point.

 * A Point3 is a 3D location in an affine space described by three values along
 * the X, the Y and the Z axis. Note the difference with Vector3 wich is defined
 * as an array and ensures that the three coordinates X, Y and Z are consecutive
 * in memory. Here there are three separate attributes. Further, a point has no
 * vector arithmetic bound to it (to points cannot be added, this would have no
 * mathematical meaning).
